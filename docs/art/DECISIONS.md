# Art decisions

What the owner picked or rejected, newest first, with their reasons. Read before
proposing a new look. Generation details for kept art are in `recipe.md`.

## 2026-10-31: in-game art stays hand-written SVG
- Pawn pilot (SVG rigs behind `?art=new`): "looks really good", but shading
  spilled past parts into the outline, and there were general inconsistencies.
- Rejected for now: generating painted raster parts and hanging them on the rig.
- Follow-up: a shape kit where shading is clipped to its part and the outline is
  painted last, shared stroke and colour tokens, one light direction, a judge
  sheet (`tools/art/shoot.mjs`).

## 2026-10-31: the rebel rook is the stonemason
- Owner liked the sheet-1 rook (stonemason, tower great-helm, mallet on the
  shoulder). It was redrawn in the sheet-2 style with two dot eyes in the slot:
  `rebel-rook.webp`. The sheet-2 ember-eyed rook is kept as `sheet2-rebel-rook.webp`.
- Picked art must be in the house style, not copied from another sheet as is.

## 2026-10-31: the style is "armour does the talking" (sheet 2)
- "Two is definitely the style we want. It's perfect." Recipe: `recipe.md`.
- Five sheets were compared, each with 3 rows (rebels, patrol, oddballs) × 6 pieces:
  1. Bold cartoon: full human faces. Only its rook was kept.
  2. Armour talks: picked.
  3. Chibi anime: not picked.
  4. Candlelit puppets: not picked.
  5. Ink comic: not picked.
- What the owner likes in the Castle Crashers references: armour and headgear
  carry the character; faces are hidden or tiny; every character is a complete,
  distinct design that looks like it belongs in its own story, not a recolour.
  Not every character should look related.

## 2026-10-30: face experiments, all rejected
Done on an early "chunky" lineup (big heads, flat colour, thick outline).
- The chunky lineup was "better than the others" but not final; it read like
  Fallout cartoon characters.
- Toy figures with googly eyes: the bulging eyes are hard to look at.
- Bean heads: read like Lego, unappealing.
- Helmet faces on every piece: gimmicky, doesn't suit every character. (Partly
  hidden faces are fine.)
- Shape critters (geometric heads): unappealing.
- Blush and ":3" faces on the chunky lineup: the owner does want a ":3" vibe,
  but these weren't it.
- Keep: the humour and wonkiness, such as the knight on a hobby horse.

## 2026-10-30: oddball skins
- The owner wants wonky unlockable variants, like Castle Crashers' bee and bear.
- They must be our own characters, never copies.
- Each one keeps its chess piece's headgear crest.
- Plan: finishing a run unlocks a skin; rebel side first; the first skin is the
  frog pawn.

## 2026-10-30: no narrator text
- The owner hates textbook LLM prose and cute story lines in the game.
- The game and studio use labels, numbers and icons.
- The story ("Escape from Exile", hideout, patrol) stays and is unwritten.
