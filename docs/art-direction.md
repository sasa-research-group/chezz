# Chezz art direction and provenance

> **Status:** this describes the old Between Worlds look. The live Escape from

The chosen direction is hyperdimensional cosmic limbo: chess-like artifacts floating outside time. The board stays readable while the environment and special effects suggest impossible geometry.

## Production assets

- **public/art/limbo.png** — generated with the built-in image generation tool for this project, September 13–14, 2026. The selected output was copied into the repository and is served locally. Original resolution: 1672 × 941.
- All chess pieces, frames, grid squares, orbit rings, particles, overlays, and health bars are built procedurally in Three.js.
- Card diagrams and interface marks are original code-native SVG artwork.
- Sound effects are synthesized locally with Web Audio.
- Cormorant Garamond and DM Sans are bundled from Google Fonts. Their SIL Open Font License files accompany the fonts.

The earlier concept images were exploration only; they are not flattened screenshots used as the game board.

## Exact environment prompt

Generated using the built-in image generation tool, not the CLI fallback.

> Use case: stylized-concept. Asset type: production background environment artwork for a browser 3D tactics game, landscape 16:9. Create a richly art-directed hyperdimensional cosmic limbo. Central 65% of image must remain an extremely dark near-black petrol void, unobstructed negative space for a 3D board that will be rendered on top in the game. Most detail at extreme perimeter: one enormous thin pale gold eclipse ring partly cropped by upper left edge, subtle iridescent fluid ribbons weaving across bottom corners and disappearing behind unseen central area, tiny floating obsidian geometric fragments near outer edges, distant faint architectural planes and impossible stair fragments very restrained. No chessboard, no chess pieces, no text, no interface, no cards, no planets, no dense star field. Beautiful dreamlike painterly cosmic atmosphere, soft volumetric teal haze near edges with faint mauve and coral sheen in liquid, gold specks and faint dimensional lines. Deep navy and petrol black dominate 85% of image. Surreal, mysterious, quiet, expensive-looking editorial game art. Composition balanced but asymmetric; center must be empty dark and usable. No bright central light source. Not generic neon sci-fi, no spaceships, no horizon, no busy nebula. Layered subtle detail that rewards looking closely; soft film grain. Entire image is environment only.
